This solution is based on the audio processing design of the FPGA demo board
The following functions can be achieved:
1.Noise Cancellation: Reduces background noise from audio signals
2.Real-time vocal adjustment: Adjust the pitch of a human voice in real time (e.g., from male to female).
3.Echo Cancellation: Removes echoes from audio signals.
4.Music Vocal Separation: Separate vocals and music from mixed audio signals.
5.Host computer design: Realize efficient data interaction and visual display with the FPGA audio processing system, and receive the audio processing data transmitted by the FPGA through PCIE or Ethernet.
6.Voiceprint recognition and vocal classification: Voiceprint recording, voiceprint recognition, and comparison can be achieved by collecting audio through FPGA.
7.Audio classification: By collecting audio through FPGA, you can classify audio, including 10 classifications such as air conditioning sound and car horn sound.
8.Audio portrait: Collecting audio through FPGA can realize the emotional portrait of the audio character.It includes 8 final emotions such as neutral, calm, and angry.
9.Speech recognition: Recording with the help of FPGA extended version to achieve speech recognition and audio-to-text output.
